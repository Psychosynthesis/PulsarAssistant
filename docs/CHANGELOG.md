# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.2] - 2026-09-14

- **Cursor client fix**: randomUUID was unavailable in older environments.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-14

- **Grep no longer returns full paths**:  only the path relative to the project root is displayed in the context and chat.
- **Minor interface tweaks**

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-14

- **Cursor HTTP Backend**: Added a Cursor Cloud HTTP backend (`type: "cursor"`) with remote agent lifecycle management (create, adopt, delete, status refresh), repository access validation, SSE streaming via the Cursor API, and branch/PR status notes.
- **Targeted Diff Edits (`write_diff`)**: Added a `write_diff` tool for replacing either an exact line range (`startLine`/`endLine`) or a matched search string with `replace`/`content`, preserving the file's original line endings.
- **Build Command**: Added per-project `buildCommand` support and a `run_build` tool, configurable from the project settings gear menu alongside the existing `Set test command…`.
- **Tool Input Normalization**: Introduced `input-normalize` helpers to normalize LLM-provided paths, escaped slashes/line breaks, and to make `write_file` search-and-replace resilient to CRLF/LF differences and trailing whitespace.
- **Grep Filesystem Fallback**: `grep` now falls back to walking the filesystem when the B-tree index is empty or stale, so fresh files are no longer reported as missing.
- **Project Tree Initialization**: Ensured the project file tree is initialized before the first system prompt, eliminating the `(empty project)` overview placeholder.
- **Session Model Restoration**: Switching sessions now restores the last model used in that session in the panel header.
- **Removed Config Migration**: Removed legacy agent config seeding/migration; empty or missing configuration is now handled without auto-creating agents.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-12

- **Find Files Tool (`find_files`)**: Replaced deprecated `glob` with a fast `find_files` tool supporting a clean DSL (`*`, `?`, `|`, `&`, `\`), `extensions` filtering, case-insensitivity, and B-tree index acceleration.
- **Literal Substring Grep**: Converted `grep` from regex walk to fast literal substring searching powered by the project B-tree index.
- **Project Structure Tool (`get_file_structure`) & TSV Protocol**: Added dynamic file structure querying with depth control via a token-efficient TSV line protocol (`F\t<path>\tsize=<bytes>`).
- **B-Tree Node Optimization**: Removed duplicate path storage in B-tree nodes and compacted `tree.json` serialization on disk.
- **Git Command Security**: Blocked `--output` and `-o` globally across git commands to prevent unauthorized file writes.
- **Rate Limit Delay (`toolCallDelayMs`)**: Wired tool call execution delays into `BuiltinAgent` with `AbortSignal` cancellation to prevent HTTP 429 rate limit errors.
- **Assistant Payload Compaction**: `compactContext` now compresses bulky `write_file.content` and replacement text inside assistant tool call arguments.
- **Chat Tool Header Layout**: Replaced cramped tool block headers with a flex layout separating title on the left and status on the right.
- **Enhanced API Error Display**: Structured API errors into clear header badges with formatted JSON / detail text in an unobtrusive, scrollable code block.
- **Send Button Unlocking**: Fixed issue where the Send button remained disabled after an agent turn until external state changes.
- **Clean Configuration**: Removed legacy `getModelsUrl` aliases in favor of canonical `modelsUrl`.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-09-12

- **Targeted File Edits**: `write_file` now accepts either full-file `content` or a targeted `searchText`/`replaceText` replacement pair.
- **Session Resume Fixes**: Opening a project resumes the latest stored session instead of creating a new one, loads its history into the chat, and no longer creates a replacement session after deleting the active session.
- **Composer UX**: The prompt textarea and context compaction action stay enabled while the agent is running.
- **Style Layout Rework**: Split the monolithic panel styles into focused Less files for common controls, the header, the chat area, and the footer. Fixed tool file links, permission cards, footer controls, and session list layout.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-09-12

- **Project Settings Menu**: Moved `Edit configuration…` and `Manage projects & storage…` out of the agent picker into a dedicated gear menu next to `New session`.
- **Set Test Command Modal**: Added `Set test command…` to the project settings menu with a focused modal for editing the per-project `testCommand` used by `run_tests`.
- **Tool Call Summary Collapse**: Tool output in chat now collapses to a compact summary (`Grep … — N results`, `Glob … — N files`, etc.) with an explicit `Show more` / `Show less` toggle.
- **Move File Tool**: Added `move_file(sourcePath, destinationPath)` with project-root containment checks, `.git` write protection, and cross-platform path handling. Open editors use `saveAs`; closed files use `fs.rename`.
- **Project Policy Helpers**: Unified `maxTurnRequests`, `toolCallDelayMs`, and `testCommand` persistence through shared per-project config helpers.
- **Git Apply Support**: Added `git apply` to the builtin git tool. `apply --check`, `--stat`, `--numstat`, and `--summary` are read-only; actual applies and `--index`/`--cached` require permission, and `--unsafe-paths` is blocked.
- **Model Context Windows Defaults**: The `modelContextWindows` map is now materialized automatically from built-in defaults during activation when no custom values exist.
- **Removed Legacy Config Versioning**: Removed the unused `version` field and `pulsar-assistant.version` config key from the agent registry.
- **View Styling Fixes**: Restored styling for extracted plan, permission, auth, and tool-call components and fixed the composer footer layout.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-12
- **Unified Ignored Directories & Package Configuration**: Consolidated conflicting ignore directory lists from `grep.ts` and `file-btree.ts` into a single module `src/ignored-dirs.ts` (`DEFAULT_IGNORED_DIRS`). Added `ignoredDirectories` configuration option in `package.json` (`configSchema`) so users can customize ignored directories through Pulsar's Settings view.
- **Configurable Tool Call Delay (TPM / 429 Protection)**: Introduced per-project configurable delay between tool calls (`toolCallDelayMs`, defaults to 500ms, minimum 100ms) with a dedicated "Delay (ms)" control in the panel actions bar. Prevents rapid-fire API completions from hitting rate limits (HTTP 429).
- **Smart Context Compaction**: `compactContext` now preserves the full output of the most recent tool batch while summarizing older history, ensuring the model retains immediate access to freshly read files without repeatedly running the same tool calls.
- **Detailed API Error Messages**: OpenAi client parses response bodies on HTTP errors (e.g. JSON `error.message` or plain text error excerpts) instead of displaying a generic "API error 429", giving full visibility into rate limits, token limits, and retry recommendations directly in the chat.
- **View Decomposition & Architecture Refactoring**: Split monolithic `AgentView` (reduced from 3865 to ~1550 lines) into modular components under `src/view/components/`:
  - `ComposerStatusBar`: Status/thoughts/compaction notifications above the composer input.
  - `PlanBarView`: Agent task plan bar, checklist, and snapshotting.
  - `ToolCallManager`: Collapsible tool executions, diffs, line counters.
  - `PermissionManager`: Permissions review cards and authentication picker.
- **Model Reasoning & Live Status Bar**: Added real-time extraction of `reasoning_content` and `thought` from OpenAI-compatible SSE and non-streaming responses. Displayed above composer in a sleek, non-intrusive slate-blue status line (`ComposerStatusBar`).
- **Immediate Context Progress Updates**: Token context progress bar now updates immediately after each tool execution step, reflecting real-time context growth without waiting for the full turn to finish.
- **Fixed Working Indicator & Button Locking**:
  - Emitting proper `turn-start` and `turn-end` events in `AgentSession.prompt()`.
  - Fixed Send & Stop buttons remaining locked after agent finishes responding.
  - Fixed "Working..." status hanging indefinitely.
- **In-Panel Compaction Feedback**: Context compaction notifications now render directly in the composer status bar instead of popping up intrusive Pulsar system notifications.


## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-11

- **Context Capacity & Progress Bar**: Real-time token context usage bar in the panel header next to the model picker for OpenAI-compatible agents. Estimates tokens for chat history, tool calls, results, and active draft input using an offline weighted heuristic (~3.7 chars/token for ASCII, ~1.5 chars/token for Cyrillic/Unicode). Resolves context limits from user config (`pulsar-assistant.modelContextWindows`), API `/models` metadata, or built-in model defaults (Gemini 1M, Claude 200k, GPT-4o/DeepSeek/Qwen 128k, etc.) with color-coded warning thresholds.
- **Projects & Context Storage Management Modal**: Accessible via `pulsar-assistant:manage-projects`, command palette, Packages menu, or the agent dropdown menu ("Manage projects & storage…"). Displays disk usage, session counts, and B-tree index status per project with safe deletion confirmation, along with a table of active model context window limits.
- **Conversation Context Compaction**: Added a compact context button (`icon-fold`) in the panel header. Replaces completed tool outputs (e.g. large file contents, directory listings, command logs) with compact historical summaries, immediately freeing up model context window capacity.
- **Increased Tool Turns Limits**: Raised the default tool turns limit from 20 to 200 iterations for built-in OpenAI-compatible agents, and raised the maximum allowed value from 100 to 1000 in both UI input validation and execution loop clamping.
- **Modular Driver/Backend Architecture**: Refactored `AgentSession` using the Driver/Backend pattern. Protocol operations are decoupled into `AcpCliBackend` (stdio ACP) and `BuiltinBackend` (in-process OpenAI-compatible agent). Editor integrations are encapsulated in `EditorBackend`, and B-Tree project structure management is isolated in `ProjectFileTreeManager`.
- **Seamless On-the-Fly Model Switching**: Changing the model in the panel header for OpenAI-compatible agents switches the model dynamically for subsequent prompts without restarting the agent or clearing chat history.
- **Persistent Session and Context Storage**: Sessions, complete conversation histories, tool calls, and metadata are saved to disk under `${configDir}/storage/pulsar-assistant/projects/${projectName}-${projectHash}/sessions/`. Supports loading previous sessions, replaying messages to the UI, and session deletion.
- **B-Tree Project File Structure Tracking**: File hierarchy is maintained in a balanced B-tree (`BTree`, `ProjectFileTree`) with automatic exclusion of junk directories (`node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `.venv`, etc.). Persisted to `tree.json` with debounced batch updates upon editor and filesystem changes, providing fast file tree context to builtin agents.
- **Improved Composer Layout**: Increased composer textarea minimum height to 150px for comfortable multi-line prompt editing.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-10

- The header **More** row shows a compact per-session API traffic summary for
  OpenAI-compatible agents: request count plus sent and received bytes.
- The **Tool turns** input no longer shows native number spinners and is wider.
  It now sits in the right side of the actions row together with the
  **Permissions** toggle.
- Grep tool results are compacted after the model has seen them once, so
  follow-up OpenAI-compatible API calls no longer resend the full result.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-10

- API agents (`type: openai`) can list available models from the provider's
  `/models` endpoint and switch the panel model from the header selector.
- `model` is read as `defaultModel`; the new canonical name is `defaultModel`.
- Optional `getModelsUrl` overrides `{baseUrl}/models` for providers that use a
  different listing endpoint.
- When the model list is unavailable, the agent status warns and the panel keeps
  using the configured exact model.
- Model descriptions from the listing are shown in the **More** panel.
- Permission prompts gain **Allow for this session**, scoped to the current
  conversation.
- Tool output collapses to a short summary for large text output and diffs
  longer than 20 lines.
- Added a per-project **Tool turns** input to override the default
  `max_turn_requests` limit.
- Builtin `git` tool is always on (no `allowCommands`): status, diff, log,
  show, branch, blame, rev-parse, ls-files, checkout, switch, add, commit.
  Mutating operations ask for permission; push/pull/fetch, reset/rebase, and
  force branch operations are rejected.
- README.md examples added.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-10

- API agents (`type: openai`) are called in-process. Only spawned CLIs
  (`type: acp`) use ACP stdio. There is no fake in-process ACP pipe.
- Agent config and the header picker split **API** and **ACP**. Legacy
